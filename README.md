## How To Run This Project

### Install Tools

Install the tools that are introduced in [this series of lessons on LearnHowToProgram.com](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c).

If you have not already, install the `dotnet-ef` tool by running the following command in your terminal:

```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0
```

### Set Up and Run Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called "AnimalShelter".
3. Within the production directory "AnimalShelter", create two new files: `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.
4. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code. Make sure to replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values in the MySQL database connection string with your own username and password for MySQL. For the LearnHowToProgram.com lessons, we always assume the `uid` is `root` and the `pwd` is `epicodus`.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=animal_shelter_api;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }

```

### Set Up and Run Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called "PlanetaryDictionary".
3. Within the production directory "PlanetaryDictionary", create two new files: `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.
4. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code. Make sure to replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values in the MySQL database connection string with your own username and password for MySQL. For the LearnHowToProgram.com lessons, we always assume the `uid` is `root` and the `pwd` is `epicodus`.

```json
{

    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=planetary_dictionary;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }
}
```

5. Within `appsettings.Development.json`, add the following code:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Trace",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Information",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```
6. Create the database using the migrations in the Animal Shelter API project. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) to the production directory "AnimalShelter", and run `dotnet ef database update`. You may need to run this command for each of the branches in this repo. 
    - To optionally create a migration, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName` where `MigrationName` is your custom name for the migration in UpperCamelCase. To learn more about migrations, visit the LHTP lesson [Code First Development and Migrations](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net-part-time/many-to-many-relationships/code-first-development-and-migrations).
7. Within the production directory "AnimalShelter", run `dotnet watch run --launch-profile "PlanetaryDictionary-Production"` in the command line to start the project in production mode with a watcher. 
8. To optionally further build out this project in development mode, start the project with `dotnet watch run` in the production directory "AnimalShelter".
9. Use your program of choice to make API calls. In your API calls, use the domain _http://localhost:5000_. Keep reading to learn about all of the available endpoints.
